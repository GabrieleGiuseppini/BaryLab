- Particle state machine:
	- Particle::StateType struct
		- Stored in buffer as opt<.>
	- Initialized at SetTrajectory (i.e. the final call), and at Move Particle and Move Vertex
		- Only initialized if there is a trajectory, and if particle is in a triangle
	- State is:
		- Current triangle
		- Current barycentric coords
		- Target position (copy of trajectory)
	- Update:
		- For each particle that has a state:
			- UpdateParticleState(.)
	- UpdateParticleState:
		- TODOHERE


- Facilities to display:
	- Highlighted edge + "place" (for trajectory hitting edge)
