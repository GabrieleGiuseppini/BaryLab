- Walking rearc attempt:
	+ Step 1: replace voluntary displacement *superimposed* with normal force, on primary only
		+ Kinda work - but secondary acquires more velocity than primary, because primary has friction
	= Step 2: Merge CalculateTraj with StepSimulation
		= Each Update...() step moves a segment and sets velocity based on movement achieved in its remainingDt
		- Issue at ConstrainedSegmentMove:
			- If we hit edge before end of a trajectory which is completely due to mesh movement, the particle position
			  changes as it's a temporary one; at the next iteration, trajectory is zero hence we don't move
			- Should we then not update particle position but update a ray-tracing position instead?
				- Function returns remainingDt, rayTracingPosition (pos + bcoords)
	- Cleanups:
		- Nuke imparted trajectory (tool and all)
		- Nuke step-by-step
