- Walking rearc attempt:
	+ Step 1: replace voluntary displacement *superimposed* with normal force, on primary only
		+ Kinda work - but secondary acquires more velocity than primary, because primary has friction
	- Step 2: Merge CalculateTraj with StepSimulation
		- Each Update...() step moves a segment and sets velocity based on movement achieved in its remainingDt
	- Cleanups:
		- Nuke imparted trajectory (tool and all)
		- Nuke step-by-step
