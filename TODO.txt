= Split State:
	+ State not optional anymore; exists only for BLab state machine
		+ Contains optional target pos
	+ ConstrainedState moves up to root
	- Finalize:
		+ Constrained state is to be reset only @
			+ Load
			+ Move particle
			+ Move vertex
		- Traj decision with physics: switch on regime
- Fix gravity
- Physics coupling:
	+ Basic
	- Impact
		- First implementation: no apparent forces; take world forces, integrate them (incl. current velocity, leftover of previous impact of any),
		  calculate trajectory (as planned), and upon impact do classic collision response (velocity-based, not force-based), including friction
