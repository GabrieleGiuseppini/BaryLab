- Fix gravity
	- Need storage at controller
- Physics coupling:
	+ Basic
	- Impact
		- First implementation: no apparent forces; take world forces, integrate them (incl. current velocity, leftover of previous impact of any),
		  calculate trajectory (as planned), and upon impact do classic collision response (velocity-based, not force-based), including friction
